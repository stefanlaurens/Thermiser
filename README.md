# Thermiser
Indigo plugin for Heatmiser slimline PRT / PRT-HW thermostats

This plugin enables integration of the Heatmiser slimline thermostats in your Indigo home automation system. 

The plugin communicates directly with the thermostats without any additional Heatmiser hub components, but you will need a USB to RS485 converter.

See manual.pdf for detailed instructions and wiring diagrams.
